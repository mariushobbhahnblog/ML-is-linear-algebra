## Welcome to Marius Hobbhahn's Blog

On this blog I write about projects related to ML and opinions about policies and ethics. If you are interested in more details regarding my career and life in general there is also an 'about me/CV' section. 

# Short overview of me: 
I am currently doing my Masters in Machine Learning at the University of Tuebingen and am generally pretty hyped about the field while also trying to find ways in which AI can be deployed in save and fair manners. I am an Effective Altruist. I debate. I am very left leaning on social issues. My economic positions are hard to put on the left/right spectrum since I hold positions of both ends, e.g. I think more radical redistribution of wealth would be great, but markets could be applied in more areas than they currently are. If you want to know more about these positions and why I hold them I guess you will have to read my blog ;)

# Machine Learning Projects: 
In the ML projects section (TODO: link) I explain papers I have written, projects I have completed and find worth talking about and essays regarding the topic of Machine Learning in general. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of that part of the blog see my What is the ML Projects part about(TODO link) article.

# Opinions:
In the Opinions section (TODO: link) I mainly post essays and opinion pieces on ethics and policy that I think are useful to share. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of this part of the blog see my 'What is the Opinions part about' '(TODO link) article.

# One last note:
If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout, code or opinions) I would be happy if you told me. But please do it in a constructive manner.
